# Practice

This repository contains my personal practice and exercises as I progress through various tutorials and learning resources in data science and machine learning.

## üìö Included Materials

### 1. ISLR (Introduction to Statistical Learning)
- Exercises and code from the ISLR book
- Focuses on statistical learning concepts and their implementation in Python

### 2. Udemy Bootcamp: *Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp*
- Practice notebooks and mini-projects from the course
- Covers core data science libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and more

### üõ†Ô∏è More to Come
I plan to expand this repository with:
- Exercises from future courses and tutorials
- Projects and challenges for deeper learning
- Code implementations of key ML algorithms and techniques

## üí° Purpose

This repo is my hands-on learning playground. It helps me:
- Reinforce concepts through practice
- Build a reference base for future work
- Track my learning journey in data science
